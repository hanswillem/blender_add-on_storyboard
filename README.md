# Blender Add-On Storyboard

A simple add-on to make creating storyboards in Blender a little easier. 
To use it, the blendfile must be saved, and you need to place markers in the timeline to divide the scene into shots. Don't forget to place a marker at the end of the last shot.

### Blender 2.80 version

#### Export Images
Exports the images to the folder where the blendfile is saved. 
Note that it does this based on the shots (i.e. the markers) and not on the keyframes!

#### Export Audioclips
Exports the audio as clips based on the shots (i.e. the markers) to the folder where the blendfile is saved.
