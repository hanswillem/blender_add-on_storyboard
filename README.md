# Blender Add-on Storyboard

A simple add-on to make creating storyboards in Blender a little easier. 

To use it:
1. Create a storyboard with grease pencil
2. Place markers to divide the storyboard into shots (don't forget to place a marker at the end of the last shot)
3. Save the blendfile to disk
