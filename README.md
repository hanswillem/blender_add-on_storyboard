# Blender Add-on Storyboard

A simple add-on to make creating storyboards in Blender a little easier. 

To use it:
1. Create a storyboard with grease pencil (if necessary import audio).
2. Place markers to divide the storyboard into shots (don't forget to place a marker at the end of the last shot).
3. Save the blendfile to disk.
4. Now you can use the buttons of the add-on to export images and sound.

#### Setup Viewport
Creates a camera, sets the viewport display to *Only Render* and *World Background*.
